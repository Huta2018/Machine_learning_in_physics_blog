A reproducible blog for interpretable machine learning in physics & materials.

## Quickstart

1. **Install Quarto**: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
2. **Preview locally**:
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```
3. **Publish to GitHub Pages** (first time creates `gh-pages` branch):

## Notes
- Write posts in `posts/` as `.qmd` (or Jupyter notebooks).
- Add code, plots, and equations — Quarto supports them out of the box.

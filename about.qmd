I'm a computational physicist and R&D scientist working on **data-driven materials discovery** and **electrochemical sensors**.
This blog is my open notebook — translating between equations, features, and materials.

**Topics you'll see here:**
- Physics-informed feature engineering
- SHAP and interpretability for scientists
- Graph features for crystal structures
- Common pitfalls (correlation ≠ causation, extrapolation, leakage)

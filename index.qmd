Welcome! I'm building bridges between **machine learning features** and **physical intuition**.

- Short, focused posts (600–1000 words)
- Clear code snippets you can run
- Visuals that connect features to physics

Start with the first post: [What ML Sees in Crystal Graphs](posts/01_graph_features_in_materials.qmd).
